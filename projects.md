# Project 1

## Title
Parsing timing diagrams

## Data
See the (code, image) pairs on https://wavedrom.com/tutorial.html

## Goal
Make a program that "inverts" wavedrom by taking a timing diagram image and returns the text used to create it.

## Some possible tools you can use
- Multimodal LLMs
- Fine-tuning, examples
- Synthetic data generation

# Project 2

## Title
DRAM Simulator

## Data
You are given a datasheet like this https://datasheet.octopart.com/MT47H64M4BP-5E%3AB-Micron-datasheet-43377.pdf

## Goal
Produce a python program that simulates the device.
For I/O, you can see the pin assignments on page 9
Your program should take an input on the pins, and reply the way the DRAM device would.

## Possible tools
- Multimodal LLMs
- Synthetic data generation
- RAG
- Unit test generation
- Reinforcement Learning
